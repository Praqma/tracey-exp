## Usage

Download the snapshot release from Github releases and install it on Jenkins by uploading the hpi file.

Plugin is not yet officially released through the Jenkins CI update center.

## RabbitMQ Jenkins Trigger for Tracey

This plugin allows you to trigger jobs using [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/).

### Configuring the trigger

You need to add at least one server. That is done using the global configuration on Jenkins. It is only RabbitMQ host available now

![Global configuration](/docs/images/global-config.png)

Then you need to enable RabbitMQ trigger on your job

![Job configuration](/docs/images/trigger.png)

That's it. You're good to go.

#### Configuring the trigger using the Jenkins Job DSL plugin

You can configure the Tracey trigger using Jenkins Job DSL:

```
job('tracey-job') {
    triggers {
        tracey('exchangeName', 'exchangeType', 'rabbitmq-id') {
            injectEnvironment {
                payloadKey 'MY_PAYLOAD_ENV_KEY'
                payloadInjection "FOO (foo)*", "BAR [BAR]*"
            }
            filters {
                payloadRegex '\\d{5}'
                payloadKeyValue('name', 'value')
                payloadJSONRegex '$..*[?(@.id == 2)]'
            }
        }
    }
}
```

The rabbitmq host id is the unique identifier assigned to the configured host. You can set this value yourself by expanding the 'Advanced' tab in the host configuration.

### Environment

You can add the content of the received message as an environment variable to your build by checking the `Add payload to environment` checkbox.

 - `Environment variable name to store payload` Name of an environment variable to store payload received from the message that triggered this job.
 - `Regex-based extractions` This is where you define your custom injections. Plugin will inject one environment variable per capture group and one environment variable that contains the whole selection
     I.e. Letâ€™s take message below as example:
     `{ "commitId": "05e9017c42a7d2a974690f17dcde50d1e2ed86a1", "branch": "master", "repoName": "project", "repoUri": "https://github.com/path-to-project" }`
     if we apply the following extraction:
     `BRANCH_FROM_MESSAGE \"branch":\s+\"([^"']+)\" `
     as result we will get two env variables injected:
     `BRANCH_FROM_MESSAGE `contains `branch = master` (the whole match)
     and
     `BRANCH_FROM_MESSAGE_1` contains `master` (first match group)

### Filters

We also provide the option to add filters to the trigger. Currently we have three types of filters.
![Filters](/docs/images/filters.png)

The first is a `Payload regex` filter that compares the contents of a message and parses it using the configured regex. If the payload matches the provided regex, then this message triggers the job, otherwise not.

The second filter is a `JSON Basic filter` that looks to see if json-format message is match key:value format.

The third filter is a `JSON Regex filter` that looks to see if json-format message is match regex expression. More information you may find [here](https://github.com/jayway/JsonPath)

Filters are applied in order. If one of your choices rejects the payload and the message received, the message will not trigger this project.

### Self contained demo project

We also provide a self contained demo project for tracey. This demo requires docker with docker compose to work. You can find the repository [here](https://github.com/Praqma/tracey)

In order to get this up and running:

    git clone git@github.com:Praqma/tracey.git
    cd tracey
    docker-compose up

That should do it. Now you have a jenkins running on port 8080, a configured rabbitmq server and a configured job. Login details are (jenkins/demo).


## Releasing

To release a new version of this CLI on Github release you need to tag the commit to release. This will be picked up by Travis CI.

### Github auth for Travis release

Release is done a ReleasePraqma user and was securely created using `travis setup releases`

    $ travis setup releases

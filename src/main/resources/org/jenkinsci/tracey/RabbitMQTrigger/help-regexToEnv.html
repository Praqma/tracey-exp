    This is where you define your custom injections. The rules are as follows
    <ul>
        <li>Each line represents an extraction</li>
        <li>Each line must conform to the rule of KEY REGEX. There must be a space between the extraction key, and the regex. I.e <em>MYVALUE car=(\S+)</em></li>
        <li>Plugin will inject one environment variable per capture group and one environment variable that contains the whole selection</li>
        I.e. Letâ€™s take message below as example:
            <p>{
            "commitId": "05e9017c42a7d2a974690f17dcde50d1e2ed86a1",
            "branch": "master",
            "repoName": "project",
            "repoUri": "https://github.com/path-to-project"
            }</p>
        if we apply the following extraction
        <p>BRANCH_FROM_MESSAGE \"branch":\s+\"([^"']+)\"</p>
        as result we will get two env variables injected:
        <p>BRANCH_FROM_MESSAGE contains <b>branch = master</b> (the whole match) </p>
        and
        <p>BRANCH_FROM_MESSAGE_1 contains <b>master</b> (first match group) </p>
    </ul>

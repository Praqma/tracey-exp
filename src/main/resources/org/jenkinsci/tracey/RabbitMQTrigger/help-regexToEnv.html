<div>
    This is where you define your custom injections. The rules are as follows
    <ul>
        <li>Each line represents an extraction</li>
        <li>Each line must conform to the rule of KEY REGEX. There must be a space between the extraction key, and the regex. I.e <em>MYVALUE car=(\S+)</em></li>
        <li>We capture the value of the <em>FIRST</em> capture group in the regex.</li>
        <li>I.e. BRANCH_FROM_MESSAGE \"branch":\\s+\"([^"']+)\"</li>
    </ul>
